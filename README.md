# tamaki

Simple app to view commits on specific days in specific repos.

_useful for when you need to bill clients for time spent on their project and you forget to log it at the time so once
you're using git commits & memory to estimate the time you spend on it_

## Developing

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm build
```
